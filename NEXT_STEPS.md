## 🎯 Phase 1: Immediate Improvements (Next 2-3 Days)

### 1. **Expand Your FAQ Dataset** 📚
**Why**: Recruiters will test with various questions. More FAQs = better coverage.

**Action Steps**:
```powershell
# Edit data/faqs.csv and add 30-50 more FAQs covering:
# - Technical support (app crashes, bugs)
# - Billing & payments
# - Account management
# - Product features
# - Shipping & delivery
# - Returns & refunds
```

**Then reinitialize the database**:
```powershell
python scripts\init_vectordb.py
```

### 2. **Add More Test Queries** 🧪
**Why**: Shows you validate your work thoroughly.

**Action**:
- Edit `data/test_queries.csv`
- Add 20-30 real-world questions
- Run the evaluation script:
```powershell
python scripts\evaluate.py
```

### 3. **Create a Demo Video** 🎥
**Why**: Hiring managers love visual demos. Add to your resume/portfolio.

**Record**:
1. Opening the app
2. Asking 5-6 different questions
3. Showing high confidence answers with citations
4. Demonstrating escalation for unknown queries
5. Showing the metrics sidebar

**Tools**: OBS Studio (free), Loom, or Windows Game Bar

### 4. **Deploy to Cloud** ☁️
**Why**: "Live demo" > "localhost only". Makes it accessible to recruiters.

**Option A: Render.com (Free tier)**
```powershell
# Create render.yaml (I can help)
# Push to GitHub
# Connect Render to your repo
# Deploy!
```

**Option B: Google Cloud Run (Free tier)**
```powershell
# Build Docker images
docker-compose build
# Push to Google Container Registry
# Deploy to Cloud Run
```

**Option C: Railway.app (Free tier)**
- Similar to Render, very simple deployment

## 🔥 Phase 2: Advanced Features (Week 2)

### 5. **Add Conversation History** 💬
**Why**: Shows understanding of stateful applications.

**What to Add**:
- Store chat history in session
- Use previous context for follow-up questions
- Show conversation memory in UI

### 6. **Implement Hybrid Search** 🔍
**Why**: Demonstrates advanced RAG knowledge.

**Enhancement**:
- Combine semantic (current) + keyword search (BM25)
- Use reciprocal rank fusion to merge results
- Better accuracy on specific queries

**Libraries**: `rank-bm25`

### 7. **Add User Feedback Loop** 👍👎
**Why**: Shows you understand ML iteration.

**Features**:
- Thumbs up/down buttons after each answer
- Store feedback in SQLite/JSON
- Track which answers users like/dislike
- Use for model improvement

### 8. **Create a Dashboard** 📊
**Why**: Showcases data visualization skills.

**Add a new page** (`frontend/dashboard.py`):
- Query volume over time
- Top 10 most asked questions
- Average confidence scores
- Escalation rate trends
- Response time metrics

**Use**: Plotly, Streamlit charts

---

## 💎 Phase 3: Production-Ready (Week 3)

### 9. **Add Authentication** 🔐
**Why**: Shows security awareness.

**Implement**:
- Simple API key authentication
- Or OAuth2 with FastAPI
- Rate limiting (10 queries/minute)
- User sessions

### 10. **Add Caching** ⚡
**Why**: Improves performance, reduces LLM costs.

**Add**:
- Redis or simple in-memory cache
- Cache embeddings for repeated queries
- Cache LLM responses for identical questions
- Show cache hit rate in metrics

### 11. **Comprehensive Testing** ✅
**Why**: Production code = tested code.

**Add Tests**:
```powershell
# Already have test files, expand them:
# tests/test_api.py - API endpoint tests
# tests/test_embeddings.py - Embedding tests
# tests/test_vectordb.py - Vector DB tests
# tests/test_rag_pipeline.py - End-to-end tests

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src
```

### 12. **CI/CD Pipeline** 🔄
**Why**: DevOps skills are valuable.

**Setup** (GitHub Actions):
- Auto-run tests on PR
- Auto-deploy on merge to main
- Linting (black, flake8)
- Type checking (mypy)

---

## 🌟 Phase 4: Portfolio Presentation (Week 4)

### 13. **Create a README.md Showcase** 📝
**Include**:
- Project demo GIF/video
- Architecture diagram (draw.io, Excalidraw)
- Key features with screenshots
- Performance metrics (accuracy, latency)
- Tech stack badges
- Quick start guide
- Live demo link

### 14. **Write a Technical Blog Post** ✍️
**Why**: Shows communication skills + technical depth.

**Platform**: Medium, Dev.to, or personal blog

**Topics**:
- "Building a Production RAG System from Scratch"
- "Improving Customer Support with AI: A Case Study"
- "Gemini 2.0 vs GPT-4 for RAG Applications"

### 15. **Create Architecture Diagrams** 🎨
**Why**: Visual learners (recruiters) appreciate this.

**Diagrams to Create**:
1. **System Architecture**: User → Streamlit → FastAPI → Vector DB → LLM
2. **RAG Pipeline Flow**: Query → Embed → Search → Retrieve → Generate
3. **Data Flow**: CSV → Embeddings → FAISS → Search Results
4. **Deployment Architecture**: Docker containers, networking

**Tools**: 
- Draw.io (free)
- Excalidraw (free)
- Lucidchart

## 🎤 Phase 5: Interview Prep

### 16. **Prepare Your Story** 📖
**Be ready to explain**:
- Why you chose RAG over fine-tuning
- Why FAISS over other vector DBs
- Why Gemini over OpenAI
- Challenges you faced (dependency conflicts!) and how you solved them
- Performance optimizations you made
- How you'd scale to 1M FAQs

### 17. **Know the Metrics** 📊
**Memorize**:
- Number of FAQs: _____
- Average confidence score: _____
- Average response time: _____ms
- Escalation rate: _____%
- Lines of code: _____ (use `cloc` tool)
- Test coverage: _____%

### 18. **Practice Demo** 🎭
**Time yourself** (aim for 3-5 minutes):
1. Problem statement (30 sec)
2. Architecture overview (1 min)
3. Live demo (2 min)
4. Key learnings (1 min)
5. Future improvements (30 sec)
